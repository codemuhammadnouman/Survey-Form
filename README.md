# Survey-Form

This project is a simple and responsive user experience survey form built using HTML and CSS. It was created as part of my front-end development practice to learn how to build accessible, well-structured forms.

## Project Overview

The form collects basic user information such as name, email, and age, and allows users to share their opinions through radio buttons, checkboxes, and a comment section.  
It is designed to be clean, easy to use, and responsive across different screen sizes.

## Features

- Fully responsive layout with a centered card design  
- Semantic HTML structure using labels, fieldsets, and legends  
- Built-in HTML validation for name, email, and age  
- Clean and minimal CSS design  
- Smooth hover effect on the submit button

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox layout)

## What I Learned

While building this project, I learned how to:
- Structure a form for accessibility and clarity  
- Use Flexbox for layout alignment  
- Apply consistent spacing, borders, and colors for better user experience  
- Add input validation directly with HTML attributes  

## Future Improvements

- Add a thank-you message after form submission  
- Include JavaScript for form validation or interactivity  
- Enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes
